    <a href="http://chrissardegna.com/blog/posts/using-your-twitter-archive-to-visualize-your-tweets" class="content"><p>In December 2012, Twitter unveiled its “Archive” functionality, allowing users to download backups of all of their tweets. The downloaded files included a html interface for searching and reading tweets, which becomes very tedious and cumbersome with large amounts of data. The download also includes a .csv file that includes the raw data. We will be using this data for the following project. My data only goes through March 2015 because I used Shame Eraser to delete them all from my account. </p> <p>The .csv should first be reformatted to an Excel Workbook to speed up the processing of data. The data table contains the following columns:</p> <pre><code>tweet_id in_reply_to_status_id in_reply_to_user_id timestamp source text retweeted_status_id retweeted_status_user_id retweeted_status_timestamp expanded_urls </code></pre> <p>We will primarily be using the following, as well as 2 new ones we will be adding later:</p> <pre><code>...</code></pre></a>

    <a href="http://chrissardegna.com/blog/posts/apple-watch-fashion-liberation" class="content"><p>The Apple Watch is an amazing piece of everyday technology. Everything about the device, from setup to use, is very intuitive and very fun. </p> <p>I’ve never had the battery dip below 60% in a single day; I bet I could make it through a couple days without needing to enable Power Reserve mode. </p> <h1>Qualms</h1> <p>There are naturally a few complaints that I would like to express before I begin. Setup and syncing is slow, though not finicky. It works for the most part, but, for example, if you accidentally tap a switch to install an app accidentally then quickly tap it off to uninstall, the app can get stuck in a perpetual “uninstalling…” state. </p> <p>App organization can be pesky, but once you figure out how Apple chooses to shift icons around, it becomes a snap. I’ve found that a vertical arrangement that limits horizontal panning is very effective and easy to use:</p> <p><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/ymeout5hcgmlng_small.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender.jpg"></p> <p>Finally, the lack of customization of the...</p></a>

    <a href="http://chrissardegna.com/blog/posts/the-downfall-of-the-smart-appliance" class="content"><p>As technology progresses at an ever-increasing exponential rate, we will realize that “smart” devices that integrate with current ones will age at a similar faster rate than their “dumb” counterparts. Many appliances in my house have not been replaced since its construction, for instance: AC/Heating units, thermostats, ovens, stoves, showers, plumbing, and many other items are still the way they were when they were built almost 20 years ago. However, the televisions, sound systems, video game systems, and computers have been replaced quite often over the years, perhaps the computers most often.</p> <p>The products that have existed in my home since its construction all have one thing in common: they operate on their own and do not interfere with other items in my house. In today’s lingo, they are “dumb.” Seemingly obsolete. They are not dumb, however; they are actually quite clever.</p> <p>In...</p></a>

As an idea, it seems very simple: wealth will disperse on its own without any intervention. Liberals, in their infinite wisdom, love to write about how trickle-down economics is a fallacy of some sort or another. Here are some examples: </p> <blockquote> <p><em>In the Real World of Work and Wages, Trickle-Down Theories Don’t Hold Up</em></p> <p>The surface plausibility of trickle-down theory owes much to the fact that it appears to follow from the time-honored belief that people respond to incentives. Because higher taxes on top earners reduce the reward for effort, it seems reasonable that they would induce people...</p></blockquote></a>

    <a href="http://chrissardegna.com/blog/posts/get-an-app-approved" class="content"><p>This is the story of my five-month-and-counting process for getting one of my apps, MineIDs, approved by Apple. What follows is the most hypocritical, illogical, and unspecific thread with the review board that I’ve ever seen. I’ve inserted my commentary with <em>italics</em>.</p> <p>At first, the app was pretty basic but still very useful to people who run Minecraft servers or use world-building tools. It looked like this when I first submitted it, and in mid-December I caved and used iOS 7 UIKit.</p> <p>Binary Rejected</p> <p>Apple Oct 12, 2013 03:56 PM</p> <p>2.21</p> <p>Your app is primarily a game guide for Minecraft. Game guides provide functionally more like books than native iOS apps, and are therefore not appropriate for the App Store, as noted in the App Store Review Guidelines. <em>I’m at a complete loss as to how this was ruled at all.

They didn’t decide to protect free speach, for example, because they enjoyed books. They thought very hard (and made some apt conclusions) about what free speech (or self-defense, or rights) actually means and then wrote the constitution based on whether that essence should be protected, not its manifestation that was visible to them, i.e., books.</p> <p>They knew that there was once a time before books were invented, and many plans were sent awry when the people who set them in motion failed to anticipate books. Therefore, the founding fathers struggled to create such laws that would be true regardless of what shape...</p></a>

    <a href="http://chrissardegna.com/blog/posts/more-rungs" class="content"><p>In a free market, demand is always a function of price: the higher the price, the lower the demand. Evidently most politicians today would be surprised to learn that these rules apply equally to both prices and wages. When employers evaluate their labor and capital needs, cost is the primary factor. When the cost of hiring low-skilled workers moves higher, jobs are lost. Despite this, minimum wage hikes, like the ones President Obama supports, are seen by liberals as an act of governmental benevolence. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p> <blockquote class="large"> <p>An employer must be convinced that the added productivity of hiring an additional worker will exceed the added cost.</p> </blockquote> <p>When confronted with a clogged drain, for example, most of us will call several plumbers and employ the one who quotes us the lowest price. If all the quotes are too high, most of us will grab some Drano and a wrench and have at...</p></a>
