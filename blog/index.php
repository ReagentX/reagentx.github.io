		<a href="http://chrissardegna.com/blog/posts/the-console-storage-speed-bottleneck"><p>Slow storage is a problematic bottleneck for console gaming. The 5200 RPM Hard Drive and SATA II connection inside the Xbox One are the primary bottlenecks for asset decompression and loading times. Although they keep the manufacturing costs down, they dramatically increase time spent loading compressed assets on the fly, multiplying the already slow rendering from the AMD Durango processor.</p><p>SATA II is archaic and slow, so replacing the internal drive is not an adequate solution. The USB 3 ports on the back provide a perfect answer: no voided warranty, no messy deconstruction, and far faster transfer...</p></a>

		<a href="http://chrissardegna.com/blog/posts/using-your-twitter-archive-to-visualize-your-tweets" class="content"><p>In December 2012, Twitter unveiled its “Archive” functionality, allowing users to download backups of all of their tweets. The downloaded files included a html interface for searching and reading tweets, which becomes very tedious and cumbersome with large amounts of data. The download also includes a .csv file that includes the raw data. We will be using this data for the following project. My data only goes through March 2015 because I used Shame Eraser to delete them all from my account. </p> <p>The .csv should first be reformatted to an Excel Workbook to speed up the processing of data. The data table contains the following columns:</p> <pre><code>tweet_id in_reply_to_status_id in_reply_to_user_id timestamp source text retweeted_status_id retweeted_status_user_id retweeted_status_timestamp expanded_urls </code></pre> <p>We will primarily be using the following, as well as 2 new ones we will be adding later:</p> <pre><code>...</code></pre></a>

Many appliances in my house have not been replaced since its construction, for instance: AC/Heating units, thermostats, ovens, stoves, showers, plumbing, and many other items are still the way they were when they were built almost 20 years ago. However, the televisions, sound systems, video game systems, and computers have been replaced quite often over the years, perhaps the computers most often.</p> <p>The products that have existed in my home since its construction all have one thing in common: they operate on their own and do not interfere with other items in my house.
