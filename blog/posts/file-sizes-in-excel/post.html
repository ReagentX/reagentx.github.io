<p>The only metric I have to gauge traffic to this website is <a href="http://www.awstats.org">AWStats</a>, an open-source logfile analyzer that runs through my CPanel. I <a href="https://chrissardegna.com/blog/statement.html">do not</a> use any other forms of tracking. </p>

<p>AWstats is a great tool because it can generate charts and tables of various data. It is simple, lightweight, and <a href="http://www.nltechno.com/awstats/awstats.pl?config=destailleur.fr">easy to operate</a>. There is one problem that will impact usersâ€™ ability to visualize trends in the data, however:</p>

<p>Excel interprets the bandwidth column as a string and not a type of file size. Excel does not understand file sizes by default either, so to visualize bandwidth data the entire column needs to be converted formulaically.</p>

<p>Luckily, this can be accomplished with a series of nested <code>=IF</code> statements that determine the size the letters denote and multiply or divide the numbers by the correct amount:</p>

<pre><code>=(IF(RIGHT(F3,2)="MB",LEFT(F3,(FIND(" ",F3,1)-1)),IF(RIGHT(F3,2)="KB",LEFT(F3,(FIND(" ",F3,1)-1))/1024,IF(RIGHT(F3,2)="GB",LEFT(F3,(FIND(" ",F3,1)-1))*1024,0))))*1</code></pre>

<p>This formula uses MB as the default unit.<sup><a href="#fn91693" id="fnr91693" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> If the formula sees the letters <code>&quot;MB&quot;</code> it will take all of the numbers to the left of the <code>space</code> character. If it does not meet this case, it checks for <code>&quot;KB&quot;</code>. If it finds a match, it takes the all of the numbers to the left of the first <code>space</code> character and divides it be 1024 to get the proper quantity in MB. If it still has not found a match, the formula checks for <code>&quot;GB&quot;</code>. If it finds a match, it multiplies all of the numbers to the left of the first <code>space</code> character by 1024 to get the quantity in MB. Finally, if no matches are found, the formula outputs 0. Multiplying this result by 1 ensures it is changed from a string of numbers to a number.</p>

<p>The entire data source is now 5 columns. To visualize this, select the relevant data and build a new chart. In the Data Source Selector delete the original text-formatted column so it looks like this:</p>

<p>To better visualize the data, use a log scale. This allows charts that plot large spreads to be more easily consumed, as massive spikes will not obscure small changes. Apply some visual styling and voila!</p>

<p>This equation would be made much simpler by the <code>=IFS</code> <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/IFS-function-36329a26-37b2-467c-972b-4a39bd951d45">function</a>, which is only available on Windows at this point. Hopefully, in the future, Microsoft will also allow Excel to interpret file sizes properly.</p>
