<p>The founding fathers, and the greater philosophical tradition to which they belong (together with such movements that influenced the French Revolution and the Magna Carta), were very intelligent men, and they build their ideas upon those of other, even more intelligent men. They didn’t decide to protect free speach, for example, because they enjoyed books. They thought very hard (and made some apt conclusions) about what <a href="http://www.federalistblog.us/2008/10/freedom_of_speech_and_of_the_press/" rel="nofollow">free speech</a> (or <a href="https://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_29.html" rel="nofollow">self-defense</a>, or <a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm" rel="nofollow">rights</a>) actually means and then wrote the constitution based on whether that essence should be protected, not its manifestation that was visible to them, i.e., books.</p>

<p>They knew that there was once a time before books were invented, and many plans were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning" rel="nofollow">sent awry</a> when the people who set them in motion failed to anticipate books. Therefore, the founding fathers struggled to create such laws that would be true regardless of what shape their subject takes. This is because they did not cut philosophical corners and rationally addressed the heart of each issue. The American Constitution is great precisely because it is written centuries ago and still applies - it was expressly devised so as to remain applicable forever, but smaller minds wish to revise it without deep thought, just based on what is expedient in the short-term.</p>

<p>One may claim that these new inventions have changed everything, that the founding fathers never thought of this, and that their writings are now invalid. No! This contention was addressed literally centuries ago. The founding fathers anticipated things would be invented that they could not predict. Therefore, they prescribed only things that they thought would be true no matter what new technology is invented.</p>

<p>The really profound thing is what the Constitution of the country represents. Think about it: although ultimately, all laws are changeable, the Constitution is meant to be those that are most difficult to change. It is the set of the most fundamental principles a country is founded upon. There are some countries that change their constitutions like a girl changes clothes, but a real constitution ought to be adopted with an extremely long term horizon in view, and kept constant with the great tenacity in the face of contemporary difficulties (in this last regard, many, many countries have failed, but the American Constitution prevailed through over two centuries-more proof of it sagacity).</p>

<p>Rights are not gifts from one man to another, nor from one class of men to another. It is impossible to discover any origin of rights otherwise than in the origin of man; it consequently follows that rights appertain to man in right of his existence, and must therefore be equal to every man.</p>

<p>By no means have I claimed founding fathers were perfect and could do no wrong. They even said they were fallible themselves. They provided faculties for amendments of the Constitution because they knew they would be very likely to make some mistakes. But given what they did right, if you’re gonna mess with the Constitution, your contentions better have extremely solid logical and philosophical bases. You can’t just throw whole swaths of it because someone shot at a school or because some kids call themselves Anonymous and “hacks” things on the internet. This is not to downplay said events, however a knee-jerk reaction to a philosophically sound documents does not a valid argument make. This would speedily degrade the value of the American Constitution, making it just like the dozens of others that have failed, destined to fail just like them.</p>
