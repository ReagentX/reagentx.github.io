<p>A market is defined as a place where buying and selling occurs. Without buying and selling, without trade, there is no market. A person who makes something and never trades anything for it is not engaging in a market transaction. Right now I am wearing a shirt. The shirt is simply sitting on my body and is not being used as a market transaction. However, when I bought the shirt it was. Without buying and selling, without trade, without exchanging value for value there is no market.</p>

<p>Since the market is a place where buying and selling occurs, the market by definition respect people’s property rights for this they didn’t there would be no buying and selling. A buyer acknowledges respects the property of the seller for if he didn’t he wouldn’t be a buyer. A buyer is someone who is handing over money in exchange for some good or service. This very action means the buyer respects the private property right of the seller, for if he didn’t he wouldn’t be a buyer. He wouldn’t exchange his money for the seller’s services, he’d simply steal the seller’s services. Why give up something one values less in order to get something one values more when one don’t have to give up anything, you can simply steal it?</p>

<p>The fact that one chooses to be a buyer instead of a thief means one respects the seller’s property rights. A buyer is part of the market, a thief is antithetical to the market. Likewise, the seller respects the property of the buyer, for if he didn’t he wouldn’t part with his goods or services, he’d simply steal the potential buyer’s money. Therefore, the market by definition is a voluntary process where property rights are respected. Thieves are anti-market for the simply fact that when a thief takes away a seller and/or buyer’s merchandise/medium of trade. This removes the ingredients necessary to have a market (buyers and sellers). A person who comes to rob someone is not engaging in a market transaction; a person who goes into a store and buys a can of soda is.</p>

<p>Anyone who says that a government is part of the market and is needed for capitalism to occur is ignorant of what capitalism and markets are. Markets are voluntary organizations and capitalism is a result of savings and using production goods to to invest in consumption goods. The government doesn’t do investment or save or add to production. Like a thief, the government is an anti-market group of people.</p>
