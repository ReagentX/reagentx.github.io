<p>As of today, my blog is live on Apple News! You can open this blog in the news app <a href="https://apple.news/TPdX6TyWiTiyRH4McJUb5Yg" rel="nofollow">here</a> or continue browsing as you normally would. </p>

<p>Currently I am waiting for the release of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/" rel="nofollow">Apple News Format</a>, which will allow me to enable native pages in the Apple News application. <del>Until then, the app just loads a webview.</del></p>

<p>Once Apple makes the official announcement, I will make the necessary changes to get the rest of my blog into Apple News. This will mean I will be publishing more articles!</p>
