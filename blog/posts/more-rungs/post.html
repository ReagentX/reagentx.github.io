<p>In a free market, demand is always a function of price: the higher the price, the lower the demand. Evidently most politicians today would be surprised to learn that these rules apply equally to both prices and wages. When employers evaluate their labor and capital needs, cost is the primary factor. When the cost of hiring low-skilled workers moves higher, jobs are lost. Despite this, minimum wage hikes, like the ones <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/07/obama-minimum-wage_n_4235965.html" rel="nofollow">President Obama supports</a>, are seen by liberals as an act of governmental benevolence. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

An employer must be convinced that the added productivity of hiring an additional worker will exceed the added cost.

<p>When confronted with a clogged drain, for example, most of us will call several plumbers and employ the one who quotes us the lowest price. If all the quotes are too high, most of us will grab some Drano and a wrench and have at it. Labor markets work the same way. Before bringing on another worker, an employer must be convinced that the added productivity will exceed the added cost. This includes not just wages, but all payroll taxes and other benefits employers are required to pay for. This is the only reason an employer hires someone: the benefit an employee adds to the company is less than what their salary is. If this were backwards, the company would be operating inefficiently and would fail as expenditures exceeded income. So, if an unskilled worker is capable of delivering only $6 per hour of increased productivity, such an individual is made legally unemployable with a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.</p>

<p>Low-skilled workers must compete for employers’ dollars with both skilled workers and capital. For example, if a skilled worker offers to do a job for $14 per hour that two unskilled workers can do for $6.50 per hour each, then it makes economic sense for the employer to go with the unskilled labor, thus over time developing skilled workers. Increase the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, and all of a sudden the unskilled workers are priced out of their jobs. This dynamic is precisely why <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2007/02/union-members-not-minimum-wage-earners-benefit-when-the-minimum-wage-rises" rel="nofollow">labor unions</a> are such big supporters of minimum wage laws: even though none of their members actually earn the minimum wage, the law helps protect their members from having to compete with lower-skilled workers. By removing the ability for unskilled workers to begin climbing this labor ladder, proponents of the minimum wage not only increase unemployment but also create long term negative effects where unskilled labor is nearly unemployable.</p>

<p>Furthermore, employers also have the choice of whether to employ people or machines. For example, an employer can hire a receptionist or invest in an automated answering system. The next time you are screaming obscenities into the phone as you try to have a conversation with a computer, you know what to blame for your frustration. In 2011, McDonalds <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2011/05/16/computers-soon-orders-european-mcdonalds/" rel="nofollow">replaced cashiers</a> at 7,000 locations with computerized ordering systems. If employing people to serve customers becomes too expensive, machines and a handful of skilled programmers will be used to replace swaths of entry-level jobs.</p>

<em>Youth unemployment across the Eurozone.</em></p>

<p>There are numerous other examples of employers substituting capital for labor simply because the minimum wage has made low-skilled workers uncompetitive. For example, handcarts have replaced skycaps at airports. The main reason fast-food restaurants use paper plates and plastic utensils is to avoid having to hire dishwashers. As a result, many low-skilled jobs that used to be the first rung on the employment ladder have been priced out of the market. Can you remember the last time an <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes393031.htm" rel="nofollow">usher</a> showed you to your seat in a dark movie theater? When was the last time someone other than the cashier not only bagged your groceries, but also loaded them into your car? It won’t be long before the cashiers themselves are priced out of the market, replaced by automated scanners, leaving you to bag your purchases with no help whatsoever. Many large stores are already testing this. At Target’s and Lowes’ Express Checkout lines,  one attendant is required to administer four independent checkout stations. This not only increases speed of transactions but also reduced the need for extra employees, thus increasing efficiency for the customer and the employer.</p>

Remove the bottom rung from the employment ladder and many never have a chance to climb it.

<p>The disappearance of these jobs has very broad economic and societal consequences. First off, jobs are a means to improve skills so that low skilled workers can offer greater productivity to current or future employers. As their skills grow, so does their ability to earn higher wages as they become more valuable to their employer. However, remove the bottom rung from the employment ladder and many never have a chance to climb it.</p>

<p>The next time you are pumping your own gas in the rain (unless you are in a state that has made it <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/18812/why-cant-you-pump-your-own-gas-oregon-and-new-jersey" rel="nofollow">illegal to pump your own gas</a>), don’t just think about the teenager who could have been pumping it for you. Think about the auto mechanic he could have become – had the minimum wage not denied him a job. Many auto mechanics used to learn their trade while working as pump jockeys. Between fill-ups, checking tire pressure, and washing windows, they would spend a lot of time helping – and learning from – the mechanics. Because the minimum wage prevents so many young people (including a <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/21/through-good-times-and-bad-black-unemployment-is-consistently-double-that-of-whites/" rel="nofollow">disproportionate number of minorities</a>) from getting entry-level jobs, they never have the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to command higher paying jobs. As a result, many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">turn to crime</a>, while others subsist on <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/welfare-statistics/" rel="nofollow">government aid</a>.</p>

<p>Supporters of the minimum wage often  argue that it is impossible to support a family on the minimum wage. While that is true, it is completely irrelevant, as minimum wage jobs are not designed to support families. In fact, many people earning the minimum wage are themselves supported by their parents. The way it is supposed to work is that people do not choose to start families until they can earn enough (are actually able to) to support them. Just like a company cannot hire more workers than it can afford, people should refrain from creating stronger draws on limited income. Lower wage jobs enable workers to eventually acquire the skills necessary to earn wages high enough to support a family. Does anyone really think a teenager with a paper route should earn a wage high enough to support a family? Is he that valuable to his employer?</p>

<p>The only way to increase wages is to increase worker productivity. If wages could be raised simply by government mandate, we could set the minimum wage at $100 per hour and solve all problems. This is no more ridiculous an idea than an arbitrary $10.10 an hour, why stop there? Why not $20? Why not $50? It should be clear that, at that level, most of the population would lose their jobs, and the remaining labor would be so expensive that prices for goods and services would skyrocket. That’s the exact burden the minimum wage places on our poor and low-skilled workers, and ultimately every American consumer. Within the Keynesian argument, there is an admission that driving this wage too high would be negative. They already agree that raising wages decreases employment, which is why Obama said $10.10 an hour and not $100 an hour. It is a matter of degree. However, there is no logical way one can come to an exact “perfect” number; the numbers proponents cite are completely arbitrary.  The only minimum wage that would solve our problems is zero.</p>

<p>Our leaders cannot even grasp this simple economic concept. How can we expect them to deal with the more complicated economic problems that currently confront us?</p>
