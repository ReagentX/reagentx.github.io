<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics" rel="nofollow">Trickle-down economics</a> and the “trickle-down theory” are terms in United States politics to refer to the idea that tax breaks or other economic benefits provided to businesses and upper income levels will benefit poorer members of society by improving the economy as a whole. As an idea, it seems very simple: wealth will disperse on its own without any intervention. Liberals, in their infinite wisdom, love to write about how trickle-down economics is a fallacy of some sort or another. Here are some examples: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the Real World of Work and Wages, Trickle-Down Theories Don’t Hold Up</em></p>

<p>The surface plausibility of trickle-down theory owes much to the fact that it appears to follow from the time-honored belief that people respond to incentives. Because higher taxes on top earners reduce the reward for effort, it seems reasonable that they would induce people to work less, as trickle-down theorists claim. As every economics textbook makes clear, however, a decline in after-tax wages also exerts a second, opposing effect. By making people feel poorer, it provides them with an incentive to recoup their income loss by working harder than before. Economic theory says nothing about which of these offsetting effects may dominate.</p>

<p><em>The embarrassing truth about trickle-down</em></p>

<p>Hoarding of wealth only makes it more likely that prosperity will not trickle down. Nobel-prize winning economics Professor Joseph Stiglitz has discussed the rise of ‘rent-seeking’ – which includes the rich using their wealth to lobby government to ensure policies continue to favour their needs and desires. Furthermore, as the rich get richer, they become increasingly isolated from the rest of us – making them less empathetic and so less supportive of the welfare state.</p>

<p><em>Trickle Down Economics Debunked in One Chart</em></p>

<p>A very general part of trickle-down economics is that by leaving profits in the pockets of millionaires and billionaires, they will have more money to invest in business, or, being the good Keynesians that they inevitably are, spend on goods and therefore stimulate the economy. However, this <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money" rel="nofollow">chart</a> by NPR shows that the rich do not do these Keynesian things with their money. They sit on it – placing it in savings accounts so that they may retire in luxury. The justification for tax cuts for the upper class seems to be unwarranted, and many Americans evidently think so too.</p>

<p>Conservatives <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-paul-gosar/a-rising-economic-tide_b_3048675.html" rel="nofollow">like to say</a> that “a rising tide lifts all boats.” In other words, if an executive makes $20 million a year, his income will eventually trickle down into the rest of the economy and ultimately benefit poor people.</p>

<p>But that theory hasn’t exactly proven true. The highest-earning 20 percent of Americans have been <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/sotu/SOTU_2014_CPI.pdf" rel="nofollow">making more and more</a> over the past 40 years. Yet no other boats have risen; in fact, they’re sinking. Over the same 40 years, the lowest-earning 60 percent of Americans have been making less and less.</p>

<p>It is fair to say that these liberal publications are representative of a general liberal mindset, and therefore the general liberal mindset is opposed to a system of trickle-down economics. Conversely, many leftist publications like <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jared-bernstein/maybe-quantitative-easing-was-helping_b_5208510.html" rel="nofollow">Huffington Post</a> and <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/07/09/federal_reserve_ending_qe3_the_program_will_cease_in_october.html" rel="nofollow">Slate</a> are in favor of a policy of quantitative easing (QE). While it has been argued by many conservatives that quantitative easing causes <a href="http://www.schiffradio.com/blog?action=blogArchive&amp;amp;blogTag=quantitative%20easing" rel="nofollow">inflation</a>, very few liberals oppose it. Interestingly enough, quantitative easing is, quite literally, a form of trickle down economics. Naturally, the Obama-appointed Janet Yellen or the Bush appointed Ben Bernanke would never admit this, but a rose by any other name is still a rose.</p>

<p>Now, lets break this down.</p>

<p>We can demonstrably argue that quantitative easing is literally inflation - QE creates more money, thereby inflating the moneys supply, which is the classical  definition of inflation. Faced with this problem, consumers in the middle class are taking on more non-housing debt in order to maintain the same standard of living. In addition, the US government – which continues to run a deficit year after year – continues to accumulate debt. Due to these facts, total debt outstanding – aka credit market instruments for all sectors - is at all time highs. More debt means more interest payments and lower savings rates. These trends do not bode well for the middle class consumer.</p>

<p>Conversely, quantitative easing has been a boon to the wealthy. It has inflated the prices of assets such as property, bonds, stocks, and non-home real estate:</p>

<p><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/jibrqajm1tdw_small.jpg" alt="20140102_wealth3-2.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Home prices in Detroit are going up despite the fact that the city is bankrupt. The “housing occupancy” table is meant to show what appears to be a higher than average amount of speculative demand i.e. lower than average owner occupancy rates.</p>

<p>Seeing this - wealth being directed into the hands of the wealthy by a Federal Reserve that claims to want to reduce income inequality - we can only conclude that they are trying to literally use trickle-down economics. By inflating the currency, poorer people have less purchasing power and by inflating asset bubbles the wealthy get wealthier. The Federal Reserve is not doing anything but allow the wealthy to become wealthier and then hope the wealth will trickle down to the poor - a policy the Federal Reserve and the leftists that appointed its members disagree with.</p>

<p>This blatant hypocrisy stems either from a lack of understanding of the effects of quantitative easing - unintended consequences - or something much darker. Perhaps, like Saul Alinsky argued in his book <em>Rules for Radicals</em>, it is an attempt to create a division between haves and have-nots, thus further dividing the country against itself. If division is their goal, there are very dark times ahead.</p>
