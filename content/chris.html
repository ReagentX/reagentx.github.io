%# About Me

My name is Christopher Sardegna.
I am a software engineer passionate about open source, data analytics, and clean code.

## Technologies

I most enjoy working in Python and Javascript. My favorite editor is VSCode and some of my favorite libraries are Requests, D3, NumPy, and Django.

I write a lot of code, which you can read on my <a href="https://github.com/ReagentX">[GitHub]</a>(https://github.com/ReagentX).

To learn more about my professional experience, you can see my <a href="https://represent.io/css">[resume]</a>(https://represent.io/css).

I also write about technology, design, data analysis, and data visualization on my <a href="https://chrissardegna.com/blog/">[blog]</a>(blog).
